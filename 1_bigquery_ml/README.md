# üîç BigQuery ML
BigQuery ML enables users to create and execute ML models in BigQuery using SQL queries.  
The goal is to:
* democratize ML (because SQL is easy)
* increase development speed by eliminating the need for data movement

# Create a model
```sql
#standardSQL
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `dataset_name.sample_model` 
OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS
SELECT
  IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170631'
LIMIT 100000;
```

Note: there is a `label` column.

# Model info & training statistics
Click on model name to get information about it.  
Under `Details`, you should find some basic model info and training options used to produce the model.  
Under `Training Stats`, you should see a table similar to this:

# Evaluate model
```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ml.EVALUATE(MODEL `bqml_codelab.sample_model`, (
SELECT
  IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'));
```

If used with a linear regression model, the above query returns the following columns: mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, mean_squared_log_error, median_absolute_error, r2_score, explained_variance.  
If used with a a logistic regression model, the above query returns the following columns: precision, recall, accuracy, f1_score, log_loss, roc_auc.  

Note: we're calling `ml.EVALUATE`  

You should see a table similar to this:
